created a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills and projects as an aspiring web developer. The website features a sleek and responsive design, starting with a captivating header that includes my name and a brief introduction. The About section provides a glimpse into my background, complemented by a professional image and a short bio highlighting my expertise. My key skills are prominently displayed in the Skills section, while the Projects section showcases my work with detailed descriptions and visuals. Additionally, visitors can download my resume in PDF format from the Resume section. The Contact section offers easy access to my email and phone number for potential opportunities. Finally, the footer includes a copyright notice and links to my social media profiles. This project reflects my dedication to web development and my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing websites.
